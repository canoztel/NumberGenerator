# NumberGenerator

Hello everyone!
HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT are used in this application. 
The purpose of the application is to change the color of numbers in a certain range according to their odd, even and primality status.
As you can see, the background of even numbers is green, odd numbers have a yellow background and prime numbers have a red background.
I hope I could help. good work :)
